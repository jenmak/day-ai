To clear the frontend cache, you have a few options:

1. **Browser Developer Tools Method:**
   - Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage tab
   - Find "Local Storage" in the left sidebar
   - Click on your domain (localhost:3000 or your production domain)
   - Find and delete the "place-store" key
   - Refresh the page

2. **Browser Console Method:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Run: localStorage.removeItem('place-store')
   - Refresh the page

3. **Clear All Browser Data:**
