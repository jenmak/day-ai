echo "ðŸ”§ Latitude/Longitude conversion fix:"
echo "1. âœ… Fixed GeolocationService: Added Number() conversion for lat/lng"
echo "2. âœ… Fixed Zod schemas: Added string-to-number transformation"
echo "3. âœ… Added proper validation for both string and number inputs"
echo "4. âœ… Added range validation for lat/lng values"
echo "5. âœ… Fixed all TypeScript type errors"

echo "ðŸŽ¯ This fixes the potential cause of tRPC errors:"
echo "- âœ… API responses with string lat/lng are now converted to numbers"
echo "- âœ… Zod validation properly handles both string and number inputs"
echo "- âœ… Type safety is maintained throughout the application"
echo "- âœ… No more type mismatches in geocoded address data"

echo "ðŸ“‹ Next steps:"
echo "1. Commit these changes to your repository"
echo "2. Deploy to Railway:"
echo "   - Backend: railway up --detach"
echo "   - Frontend: railway up --detach"
echo "3. Test with a location search"

echo "- String lat/lng values from OpenCage API"
echo "- Mock geocoding data conversion"
echo "- Zod schema validation errors"
echo "- Type mismatches in place creation"
